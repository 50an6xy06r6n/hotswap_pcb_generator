# STLs
Some pre-generated STLs to give you an idea of what the output looks like, as well as to let you test the fit of your components before you print a full PCB.

### `default_layout`
Contains STLs generated from `default_layout.scad`, which is the left side of a 4x6 split layout I designed. Includes a PCB and 3 kinds of cases. The first is a basic sandwich case with a plate and backplate attached with standoffs. The second is a slab case in the same profile as the sandwich case. The third is a chamfered and sloped case in a chunkier layout with no concavities in the profile.

### `diode_bending_template`
Contains STLs for all 3 types of diode bending templates.

### `individual_components`
Contains single instances of each of the sockets that interfaces with an external component. You can print them to test the fit with your printer's settings and tolerances and adjust the parameters before you spend time printing a full PCB.
