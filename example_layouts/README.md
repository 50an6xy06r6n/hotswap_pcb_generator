# Example Layouts
Just a few example layouts, each with a KLE json and the corresponding SCAD file. The JD40 layout is straight out of the conversion script, but for some of the others I've made them a little prettier by doing stuff like connecting thumb clusters and adding standoffs. Hopefully this can give an idea of what's possible.
